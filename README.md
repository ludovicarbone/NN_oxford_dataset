# NN_oxford_dataset
Final project of the Advanced Machine Learning course 2024-2025

Authors:
- Samuele Toniazzo (mat.918624)
- Ludovica Carbone (mat.866609)
- Emilio Toli (mat.920337)

Instructions:
For running correctly the source code, the folder "CTT_AML_Progetto_24-25" must be present in the 'My Drive' directory, if this is not possible you should change the path from the variable base_path present in the notebook at the section "Loading and preprocessing data".

The dataset is located in the Drive folder and is called "102flowers.tgz" which is a compressed file in TGZ format. The source code will automatically handle its decompression and image loading.

The first notebook to be opened is "transfer_learning_AML.ipynb" which contains the dataset analysis.

In the notebook transfer_learning_AML.ipynb you can find the analysis of the dataset and the trasnfer learning project 
In the notebook CNN_AML.ipynb you can find the CNN part
